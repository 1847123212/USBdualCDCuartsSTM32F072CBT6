# USBdualCDCuartsSTM32F072CBT6

DMA-accelerated multi-UART USB CDC for STM32F072CBT6 microcontroller as Keil uVision5 project
==============================================================================================

Based on the example by majbthrd from 
https://github.com/majbthrd/stm32cdcuart 

This code is ported and tested for the STM32F072CBT6 with two UASRTS:
UART1 and UART3

Changes are in the GPIO and AFR registers. The source from the original project is imported into a Keil uVision 5 type project.

Enjoy!
